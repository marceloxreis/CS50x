## :label: **About CS50**

**[CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)** is an online introductory course on computer science and programming. It teaches the languages C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS & JavaScript, as well as fundamental computer science concepts such as algorithms & data structures, abstraction, encapsulation, resource management, security, and the Flask web framework.

## :computer: **About the Repository**

An important part of the course, it's submitting the labs and problem sets, as well as the final project for feedback. This repository contains the solutions I've come up with for the problem sets.

Also down below are links and short descriptions for each of the projects. If you'd like to read more about the implementation requirements, there's a link in each folder that will lead to them.

## :closed_book: **Academic Honesty**

Keep in mind the course's [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/). You should try figuring out a solution yourself before looking at other implementations. Also, bear in mind that I am a beginner, I've taken the course to learn, so the solutions might not be the best implementations.
